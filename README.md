# 📂 Dotfiles + NixOS

> ‘Purpose’ – This repo stores my NixOS system configuration **and** personal dotfiles.  
> By running a couple of tiny scripts I can spin up any machine, drop the right symlinks into `/etc` and `$HOME`, and instantly have *all* my configs back.

---

## 🚀 Quick‑Start

I recommend first installing your NixOS on your drive before using this repo. While it's possible using this repo while installing NixOS, the scripts will target system-wide files (/etc, /home) instead of your mounted installation (/mnt/sda). Plus the profiles are based on your `/etc/machine-id` which will change between your installation media and your installed system.

```bash
# 1️⃣ Clone the repo somewhere safe
git clone https://github.com/your‑username/dotfiles-nixos.git ~/src/dotfiles-nixos
cd ~/src/dotfiles-nixos
```

### 1️⃣ Create a machine profile *(optional but recommended)*  

‘Run **once** per machine to give your NixOS install a friendly name. Future versions of `init.sh` will also handle hostname and hardware moves.’

```bash
# Creates /etc/nixos/profiles/ and a readable symlink
./init.sh
```

### 2️⃣ Install the symlinks  

‘This links everything from the repo into `/etc` and `$HOME` while safely backing up any existing files.’

```bash
# From the repo root
./setup.sh               # will prompt for sudo when needed
```

## 📂 Repository Layout

| Path | What it contains |
|------|------------------|
| `etc/` | System-level NixOS files (symlinked into **/etc**) |
| `home/` | Personal dotfiles (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, …) — ignores **.config/** and **.local/** |
| `home/.config/` | Personal config files (`hypr`, `fastfetch`, …) — handled separately |
| `home/.local/` | User local data — handled separately, ignores **share/** |
| `home/.local/share/` | User share data — handled separately, ignores **icons/** |
| `home/.local/share/icons/` | User icon themes — handled separately |
| `init.sh` | Prepares `/etc/nixos/profiles/`, creates a human-readable profile symlink |
| `setup.sh` | Backs up existing files, then creates the symlinks |

---

### 🔎 Behavior Summary

Each level is synced independently:

- `home/` does **not** touch `.config/` or `.local/`
- `.config/` is handled on its own
- `.local/` is handled on its own (excluding `share/`)
- `.local/share/` is handled on its own (excluding `icons/`)
- `.local/share/icons/` is handled on its own

This keeps recursion clean and prevents overlapping symlink logic.

## 🤔 Why symlinks instead of Home Manager?

I love the idea of Home Manager, but for my workflow a **plain‑old‑symlink** approach feels cleaner and less of a struggle:

* **Zero extra layer** – Home Manager adds its own Nix modules and a separate activation step. With raw symlinks I keep the chain short: repo ➜ `/etc`/`$HOME`.  
* **Full control** – I can see exactly what file ends up where, and I can tweak the backup logic in `setup.sh` without fighting against Home Manager’s declarative model.  
* **Portability** – The same scripts work on any Linux distro that supports symlinks, not just NixOS. If I ever spin a VM that isn’t Nix‑enabled, the repo still does its job.

Bottom line: symlinks give me **predictability**, **speed**, and **cross‑platform freedom**—exactly what I need for a fast‑moving dev/gamer life.

## 🛠️ What `init.sh` Currently Does

_Prepares a per-machine profile directory for both NixOS and Hyprland, using a stable hashed machine identity._

---

### 1️⃣ Ownership Adjustment

Runs:

```bash
sudo chown "$USER:users" /etc/nixos -R
```

This allows the script to manage `/etc/nixos/profiles/`.  
(Review permissions if you prefer tighter security boundaries.)

---

### 2️⃣ Stable Machine Hash Generation

The script:

- Reads `/etc/machine-id`
- Reads `etc/nixos/machine-id-salt.txt`
- Concatenates `salt + machine-id`
- Generates a SHA-256 hash

That hash becomes the **real profile ID**.

Why this matters:

- Even if two machines share the same hostname
- Even if two machines use the same profile name

Their `/etc/machine-id` will differ, so their hashed ID will always be unique.

This guarantees:

- No collisions  
- No accidental overwrites  
- No broken deployments due to duplicate names  

The **hash is the source of truth** — not the human-readable profile name.

---

### 3️⃣ Profile Directories Created

Using the same hashed ID, the script creates:

```
/etc/nixos/profiles/<hashed-id>
$HOME/.config/hypr/hyprland.profiles.d/<hashed-id>
```

This means:

- The same machine identity is shared between **NixOS configuration** and **Hyprland configuration**
- Both systems stay aligned to the same device-specific profile

---

### 4️⃣ Human-Readable Symlink (Alias)

The script creates human-readble symlinks:

```
/etc/nixos/profiles/<profileName> → <hashed-id>
$HOME/.config/hypr/hyprland.profiles.d/<profileName> → <hashed-id>
```

These symlinks exist **only for convenience**:

- Easier navigation in IDEs
- Cleaner directory structure
- Human-friendly profile switching

The system does **not** rely on the name — only on the hashed directory.

---

### 5️⃣ `current` Symlink Handling (Hyprland)

The script regenerates:

```
$HOME/.config/hypr/hyprland.profiles.d/current → <profileName>
```

By default, current symlink is linked to `default` profile

This makes it easy for Hyprland to reference the active profile.

Each time `init.sh` runs:

- The `current` symlink is removed
- It is recreated pointing to the selected profile

---

### 6️⃣ Git Behavior

The file:

```
home/.config/hypr/hyprland.profiles.d/current
```

is marked with:

```bash
git update-index --skip-worktree
```

This means:

- Git tracks the file
- But ignores working-tree modifications
- So switching machines or profiles will not create Git noise

The `current` symlink is intentionally **machine-local state**, not repository state.

---

### 📌 Important Design Principle

- The **hashed machine ID directory** is permanent and authoritative.
- The **profile name symlink** is just a readable alias.
- The **`current` symlink** is regenerated state.
- The same hashed identity is used across:
  - `/etc/nixos/profiles/`
  - `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.profiles.d/`

This keeps device-specific configuration isolated, stable, and collision-proof.

## 🔧 What `setup.sh` Does

_Safely backs up anything that already exists, then replaces it with symlinks from the repository._

The script uses strict mode:

```bash
set -euo pipefail
shopt -s nullglob
```

- Fails immediately on errors
- Prevents undefined variable usage
- Avoids globbing issues when directories are empty

All backup logic is centralized in `backup_or_remove()`:

- If target is a **symlink** → remove it
- If target is a **file or directory** → rename it to  
  `<name>.old-<TIMESTAMP>`
- Timestamp format: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`

If the path is under `/etc`, the script automatically uses `sudo`.

---

### 1️⃣ Process `etc/`

For every file in `repo/etc/`:

- Target: `/etc/<name>`
- Remove existing symlink OR backup existing file/dir
- Create new symlink (with `sudo`)

---

### 2️⃣ Process `home/` (excluding `.config` and `.local`)

For every entry in `repo/home/`:

- Skips:
  - `.config`
  - `.local`
- Target: `$HOME/<name>`
- Backup/remove existing target
- Create symlink

This keeps top-level dotfiles isolated from nested config logic.

---

### 3️⃣ Process `home/.config/`

- Ensures `$HOME/.config` exists
- For each entry:
  - Target: `$HOME/.config/<name>`
  - Backup/remove existing
  - Create symlink

Handled independently from `home/`.

---

### 4️⃣ Process `home/.local/`

- Ensures `$HOME/.local` exists
- Skips:
  - `share`
- Targets: `$HOME/.local/<name>`
- Backup/remove existing
- Create symlink

`.local` is handled separately from `home/` and `.config`.

---

### 5️⃣ Process `home/.local/share/`

- Ensures `$HOME/.local/share` exists
- Skips:
  - `icons`
- Targets: `$HOME/.local/share/<name>`
- Backup/remove existing
- Create symlink

Handled independently from parent `.local`.

---

### 6️⃣ Process `home/.local/share/icons/`

- Targets: `$HOME/.local/share/icons/<name>`
- Backup/remove existing
- Create symlink

Icons are handled separately to avoid overlap with other `share/` entries.

---

### 🔐 Backup Naming

Backups are created like:

```
<file>.old-20250219-153000
```

This includes critical files like:

- `configuration.nix`
- Any existing dotfiles
- Any `.config` or `.local` entries

Nothing is deleted permanently — everything is preserved with a timestamp.

---

### 🧠 Design Principle

Each directory level is processed independently:

- `home/` ignores `.config/` and `.local/`
- `.config/` is handled alone
- `.local/` ignores `share/`
- `.local/share/` ignores `icons/`
- `.local/share/icons/` is handled last

This prevents recursive overlap and guarantees predictable symlink behavior.

Your system now reflects the repository exactly — with all previous state safely backed up.

---

## ♻️ Restoring Backups

‘Nothing gets deleted; everything gets renamed with a timestamp, so you can roll back whenever you need.’

```bash
# Restore a system file (e.g., hardware config)
sudo mv /etc/hardware-configuration.nix.old-20250219-153000 \
         /etc/hardware-configuration.nix

# Restore a global NixOS config
sudo mv /etc/configuration.nix.old-20250219-153000 \
         /etc/configuration.nix

# Restore a home dotfile
mv "$HOME/.bashrc.old-20250219-153000" "$HOME/.bashrc"
```

If you moved a hardware file into a profile, just copy it back from the profile directory before running `setup.sh` again.

---

## ⚠️ Safety Tips & Recommendations

- `init.sh` currently changes ownership of `/etc/nixos`; edit the script or run it manually if that bugs you.  
- No built‑in dry‑run mode – try the scripts in a disposable VM first, or add a `--dry-run` flag (happy to help you code that).  

---

## 🌟 Making It Yours

The repo is **dynamic** – anyone can clone it, wipe out my personal configs, drop in theirs, and the scripts will take care of the rest. Just take a look at [📂 Repo Layout](#📂-repository-layout)

1. Delete or rename any files you don’t need under `etc/`, `home/.config` or `home/`. Since `home/.config` uses its own loop, you may want to keep it and remove files under `home/.config` instead. Same for `.local/share` and `.local/share/icons`.
2. Add your own configuration files using the same directory layout.  
3. Run `./setup.sh` and watch the magic happen.

You can use `./init.sh` in order to create your own profile under `/etc/nixos/profiles`, just make sure to correctly import those configurations.

> Remember: the **profile** folder is for *device‑only* files (hardware config, future hostname settings). All other `.nix` files belong to the global config.

---

## 📌 Future Enhancements (TODO)

- Extend `init.sh` to automatically **move** `hardware-configuration.nix` (and any other hardware‑specific `.nix` files) into the newly created profile.  
- Add a `--dry-run` flag to `setup.sh` for previewing actions.  
- Create a `restore.sh` helper that lists all `.old-<timestamp>` backups and lets you pick which to revert.
